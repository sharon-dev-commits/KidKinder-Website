## 🔐 Authentication Flow

- User registers via `register.html`
- User data is stored in **LocalStorage**
- Login is validated using stored data
- On successful login:
  - User name is stored
  - User is redirected to `index.html`
  - Welcome message is displayed

> ⚠️ Note: This is a front-end demo project. Authentication is **not secure** and should not be used in production.
